description: Split this repo's plan.md into GitHub issues with gh, one per unit of work, after a human has reviewed the split. Use when a plan is ready and has no issues yet.

# plan-to-issues

Turns `plan.md` into GitHub issues that workers can pick up cold. Easiest with `gh`, authenticated,
in a shell this agent can run.

## Steps

1. Read `plan.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `docs/adr/`.
2. Draft the split as a table: title · plan section · scope · done when · blocked by.
   One issue per unit of work.
3. **Stop and show the table to the human.** Publish nothing until they approve it.
4. Every issue carries the shape below. Ask the human only about anything beyond it.
5. Create the label `plan:<plan>` once, then each issue in dependency order, so blocked-by can
   cite real numbers:

   ```sh
   gh label create "plan:<plan>"
   gh issue create --title "<title>" --label "plan:<plan>" --body-file <tmp.md>
   ```

6. Record every issue URL from gh's output (not from memory) and reply with the list.

## Issue shape

Label `plan:<plan>` (the `plan:` key of the plan's frontmatter). The body, in this order; the
first line is how the reviewer sorts issues:

```md
Source: plan.md § <n>

## Scope
<what to build, from that section only>

## Done when
<the section's "Done when", checkable>

## Blocked by
<#n, and which part of it; or "None.">

## Suggested model
<strongest for logic, cheaper for views and tests (AGENTS.md)>
```

An issue whose "Done when" waits on a person (a reviewer looking, an approval) stays open until
that person has acted, not until the request is sent.

Closing one, with the closing comment from AGENTS.md:

```sh
gh issue close <n> -c "<closing comment>"
```

## No `gh`

Steps 1–4 hold either way. GitHub reachable another way (a connector, the REST API, the web UI):
the same issues, made that way. GitHub issues out of reach altogether: write them as files in
`docs/issues/`, format in ADR 0004, then commit and push.

## Don'ts

- Don't paste the whole plan into one issue, and don't keep issues only in chat.
- Don't invent sections the plan doesn't have. If the plan is unclear, ask.
